**Predicting Survival on the Titanic**

Perhaps one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 people on board. Interestingly, by analysing the probability of survival based on few attributes like gender, age, and social status, we can make very accurate predictions on which passengers would survive. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class. Therefore, we can learn about the society priorities and privileges at the time.
